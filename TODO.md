- 7guis (low priority):
  - CRUD: clean up design, add CSS
  - CRUD: extract reusable parts from code
  - CRUD: select next item after eDelete
  - Circles: CSS
  - Circles: extract components, refactor, simplify
  - Cells: refactor and simplify code
  - Cells: Add graphics (CSS + markup)
  - Cells: add spreadsheet functions and ranges

- TodoMVC (low priority):
  - Include license of original TodoMVC CSS
  - Break up TodoMVC into modules
  - Simplify navigation component (TodoMVC)
  - Extract checkbox component
  - Extract a standalone DB component
  - Extract the domain model, create tests
- HNPWA:
  - Convert code to a CssWriter Monad, extend Static DomBuilder
  - Switch to the 'unofficial HN API'
  - Extract domain model, create tests
  - Read/write to IndexedDb
  - Simplify and speed up(!) dataflow
- RealWorld:
  - Build markdown view - mmark and foldl (MonadWidget m => FoldlM)
  - Add pagination (everywhere)
  - Wire up date views
  - Add edit/delete buttons to own articles
  - Add Yesod to Docker OR fix what's wrong with the Node code
  - Run integration tests
  - Create a Nix-based Docker container with Yesod code ?
  - Compare with QFPL's RealWorld
- Storage:
  - DMap for multi-entity storage? With Vinyl/OpenUnion as the index?
  - Persistent interpreter for the effect
  - RPC interpreter
  - Caching interpreter (local storage + rpc as backup)
  - Look up Datascript for inspiration on queries
  - Set up hydra on bravo.z (upgrade nixpkgs, check Jabber, set up DNS, add services.hydra)
  - https://github.com/lukeed/pwa (lukeed/pwa)
- Router:
  - Multi-frontend router/prerender
  - Asset gathering/prefetch/HTTP Push
  - ToServant <-> list of accessors isomorphism
  - SubApp combinator - that would make subroutes a lot easier, just search for the corresponding type on the typelevel...
  - Embed router into an app beneath toplevel, manage nested routers in user defined fashion (admin site vs user section)
  - HasGenerator = given a toplevel app, interpret routing effect
  - Finish allLinks combinator (links in a record)
  - Prerender CLI
  - Tie up (pre)render and server, implement an App instance for ServerT using a context item
- ServiceWorker:
  - Routing - Regex/function => caching strategy (plugins, expiration, ...)
  - <link> widgets (3rd party resources require CORS = crossorigin)
  - Background sync
  - Offline analytics
  - Push notifications
  - PushT transformer (or effect) for Servant
  - Parametric AppSW combinator
  - MatchStatic - support lists
- Next research:
  - Research validation groups, create a demo in src-snippets/
  - Research freer, create a short demo in src-snippets/ using freer-simple
  - Research vessel (HKD), create a demo in src-snippets/
  - Research routing using obelisk-route, create a demo in src-snippets/
  - Research code generation using Swagger, Hydra, gRPC - where possible, create demos in src-snippets/
  - Research Hackage packaging best practices, make a checklist
  - Create a short demo for using NetworkInfo API in src-snippets/
  - Create a demo of Snack + Reflex-dom in src-snippets/
  - Create a POC for a manually stepping reflex-host for unit tests
  - Implement a CSS prerender demo with a "component" function in src-snippets/
  - Research asset gathering and config injection in obelisk, create a POC in src-snippets
  - Implement a POC for: Asset gathering -> prerender + routing (maybe even MIME-typed?) -> http2 push per route
  - Research https://github.com/kosmikus/hkd-sop and try to use HKD in Routes/RPC (Map RouteResult (x :: Routes))
  - Serializable operations - freer <~> aeson (kind-generic)
  - Prepare a printable 'Quickref' for Reflex+Reflex-dom
  - Set up hydra-build-results/ for thesis & presentation, point README there
  - Set up hydra expressions
  - Synchronized pomodoro app as the final task
  - Create a debugConsole to the Storage effect (introspection)
  - Create a demo of storage as RequesterT with pluggable backends (map, acid) - intent - DataScript-like functionality, supporting prerender - HasStorage X => ..., fetch @X query :: m (Dynamic t (Maybe X)), DMap of Dynamics as a core? (max. 3C now)
  - obelisk-route-servant - TH interop from Servant types to GADT?
  - Try to replace ./nix with nix-path or niv, report back on issues
  - Statically compiled deploy
  - Check out reflex's chromeDriver setup, replicate it
  - Try out static HTML generation with Reflex (a la blog)
  - Benchmarks evolution, commit impack
