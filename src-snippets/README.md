# Snippets

Short snippets of code showing several component pieces of functionality. These
are intended more as a source of snippets and a playground for me, rather than a
formal demonstration.

## Deployment
- [x] Deployment of a Haskell server to NixOps (VirtualBox backend)
- [ ] Continuous deployment using Hail

## Quality assurance
- [ ] Unit tests of ? (using hedgehog, tasty?)
- [ ] Integration tests of a server
- [ ] Integration tests of a client
- [ ] End-to-end tests of a server and client together
- [ ] Simple benchmarks (criterion)
- [ ] Allocation benchmarks (weigh)
- [ ] Measuring the evolution of performance of a library
- [ ] Continuous integration using Hydra

## Tools
- [ ] A scaffolding tool
- [ ] Remote debugging console (CloudHaskell)

## Techniques
- [x] ServiceWorker
- [ ] Prebuilt frontend files
- [ ] Build-on-demand frontend

## Templates
