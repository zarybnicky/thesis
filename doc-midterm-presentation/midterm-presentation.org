* What, why?
** Frontend Haskell?
- What's Haskell?  \pause
  - /"Purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy
    evaluation"/  \pause
  - /"If it compiles, it works."/   \pause
- Why Haskell in the browser?     \pause
  - JavaScript doesn't have a monopoly on the frontend
    - Compile-to-JS (see TypeScript, see Elm)
  - Code sharing between server and client (business logic, entities)
\pause
- Many companies use it, several contribute to OSS:
  - Obsidian - Reflex, Obelisk, Rhyolite
  - Tweag - Asterius, Inline-js
  - QFPL - Reflex-workshop, many UI components
  - IOHK (Cardano) - iohk-ops

** PWA?
- New buzzword from Google
- Recent web development trend
- An /almost/ native app
  - Load a website
  - Click "Add to home screen"
  - Use like a native application

** PWA features
- /Progressive Web App Checklist/ -- Google
\pause
- "Basic PWA":
  - Responsive and fast ("Native experience")
  - Available offline
  - Has "Add to home screen"
  - Push notifications
  - Device APIs
\pause
- "Exemplary PWA":
  - Pre-rendered
  - Social share, metadata
  - Accessible
  - Full-screen mode
  - ...

** PWA technologies
- Technologies:
  - Service Workers
  - Web App Manifest
  - History API
  - Web Share API
  - Network Information API
  - Credential Management API

* What have I done?
** What have I been doing?
- Research:
  - Webapp frameworks across languages
    - PWA developers' expectations
  - Available Haskell libraries and tooling    \pause
  - \Rightarrow missing tools and libraries
  - \Rightarrow only some in scope of my thesis

\pause

- Prototypes:
  - A full-stack application
  - An offline-capable application
  - A frontend debugger toolbar
  - CI/CD for Haskell
  - ...

** What haven't I been doing?
\pause

- Regular writing
  - Blog
  - Progress reports   \pause
    - Oops...

* What's next?
** What's next?

- Must-haves:
  - Browser routing (client library)
  - Service Workers (build tool and/or client library)
  - Push notifications (server & client library)
\pause
- Nice-to-haves:
  - Pre-rendering (server library)
  - Data sync (server & client library)
\pause
- Four months should be enough, right? \Smiley

** Wrapping up
- Thanks for listening!
